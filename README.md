# Car-Pool-App-using-MERN-Stack

This project is a smart, secure, and scalable campus-exclusive carpooling solution tailored for VIT Chennai. It addresses the long-standing transportation challenges faced by day scholars, particularly the lack of reliable public transport options during extreme weather conditions. Situated far from the urban core, the campus presents a daily commuting hurdle, especially for students without personal vehicles. At the same time, numerous student-owned cars enter the campus each day with unused seating capacity highlighting an untapped opportunity for efficient ride-sharing.

By combining trusted, college-only access with intelligent, real-time ride matching, this project fosters an ecosystem of eco-friendly commuting, optimized cost-sharing, and enhanced convenience exclusively for the college students.

Powered by the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the platform connects ride-seeking students with car-owning peers through a smooth and intuitive interface. Drivers are automatically checked in via QR or RFID scans upon campus entry, activating them on the app and enabling them to post available rides, including route details, departure time, seat count, and fare. Riders can search, filter, and book suitable rides based on route overlap, timing, budget, and safety preferences. A dynamic pricing model coupled with a built-in negotiation engine ensures fairness, transparency, and flexibility for both parties.

The system is backed by a robust NoSQL database (MongoDB) that efficiently manages semi-structured data, such as user profiles, ride listings, transaction logs, reviews, and live trip data. Safety is at the core of this project’s architecture, with features including verified college-only login, gender-based filtering, real-time location tracking, panic (SOS) alerts, and post-ride rating systems. An integrated admin dashboard empowers college authorities to monitor live rides, review safety scores, address user reports, and manage dispute resolution.

Overall, this project transforms an everyday problem into a collaborative, technology-driven mobility solution reducing traffic congestion, promoting sustainability, and enhancing student life on campus.
